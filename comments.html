                            It includes a brief greeting, my name, a short description of 
                            the degree I’m studying, and some background information about me. 
                            On the navigation bar, there is a logo that allows the user to return to the About Me page. Additionally,

                            features a couple of companies I wish to work for, with a link that brings 
                            the user to the front page of the company’s website. After the user reads through 
                            the page, they must scroll back to the top to go to the final or previous pages.

                                Some of my ideas, like the animation of the texts appearing on top of the image the user hovers on, 
                                I have done in the “Past” page, it might have required some knowledge of JavaScript to achieve the desired effect and 
                                interactive elements. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                However, incorporating JavaScript would have significantly increased the complexity of the project and would have 
                                gone against the requirements set out at the beginning of this assignment. Despite this limitation, I still wanted 
                                my website to look visually appealing. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                After seeking advice from my tutor and peers, I discovered a simpler solution 
                                only using CSS. By combining a well-structured HTML layout while tweaking how it should look in CSS, 
                                I was able to create a smooth animation as shown in the previous pages and below that aligned with my original vision while staying within the project guidelines.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                                
                                </div>
                                <br>                    
                                <h3><span>Div tag</span></h3>
                                &nbsp;
                                <p>
                                    In this project, I used an extensive amount of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to manipulate how 
                                    I want the layout of my website to look. The main purpose of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is to define a division or section in an HTML dcouments. It also acts as a container for various elements.
                                    Elements such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>&nbsp; are placed within the container and then styled in CSS to control how they appear on the website.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> 
                                    Below is an example of how the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element was used in my assignment. In this case, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> helps organise and control the elements
                                    within the navigation bar, as shown by the class name <code>"navbar-rec"</code>. It also contains two different IDs, <code>"div-left"</code> and <code>"div-right"</code> 
                                    separates the contents and elements, allowing me to effectively adjust how they behave in the navigation bar. 
                                </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="assets/examples/div.png" alt="examples: How the Divs are Used" class="examplesImg">
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>expected output:</h3>
                                    <img src="assets/examples/navbar.png" alt="examples: The Expected Look of the Navigation Bar" class="examplesImg3">
                                    <br>
                                    <p>
                                    Since this was my first time delving into web development, I eneded up creating numerous classes and IDs to reference. My approach to organising 
                                    them was quite excessive, resulting in my CSS file growing to 613 lines. Moreover, throughout this assignment, there are over 100
                                    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&nbsp;tags used to achieve what I wanted through the use of classes and IDs. This will be discussed in more detail later.
                                    </p>                                
                                
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            <h3><span>Anchor text</span></h3>
                            &nbsp;
                            <p>
                                In this project I utilised the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>&nbsp; tag, which defines a hyperlink 
                                that creates a link to other webpages, files and many more. It also displays a clickable link 
                                through the href. The <code>href</code> attribute is crucial as it specifies the link’s destination. In this case, I used
                                the anchor text to make a link between the HTML pages of my website. As shown in the example below, I also used an image
                                as a link to the "About Me" page. I believed this feature would greatly enhance both the quality and accessibility
                                of my website, as it gives users an additional option to navigate back home.

                            CSS classes and IDs used throughout the website to achieve the overall look, design and functionality

                                The Web Assignment was somewhat successful in terms of accessibility. 
                                Web developers have the responsibility to ensure that websites are 
                                inclusive and allow all users to navigate and interact with the elements 
                                on the webpage easily. However, due to my lack of experience in web 
                                development, I overlooked the mobile responsiveness as I placed much 
                                emphasis on how the website will appear on a laptop. After I tested the 
                                site on different devices towards the end of the development stage, which 
                                was in week 8, the layout and contents of the website on mobile devices, such 
                                as the Samsung S20 FE, performed poorly. The text would clip into the left side, 
                                and some of the images would be too small to be read. Yet despite my lack of 
                                knowledge, I was able to successfully deliver a highly responsive website on a 
                                laptop and devices with larger screens. This was strongly evident in the “Past” 
                                page, as the animation of the images fading in and out as the user hovers the mouse 
                                over it successfully responds and reveals the text behind the icon.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Additionally, I purposefully made the text on my website large enough for those 
                                with difficulty seeing to have an easier time navigating my site. To achieve this, 
                                I tested different font sizes with many of my peers on a number of occasions, asking constantly if the text on the 
                                screen was legible. Moreover, I utilised the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag to highlight 
                                important information as well as make the content visually appealing. Furthermore, in the
                                event that the CSS of my website is turned off or unable to function, the contents of each page are still readable and 
                                intuitive to navigate and understand. 
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                As seen above, the text and images are designed extremely well that when CSS is turned off it
                                still reads well. Moreover, the images and icons used throughout the 
                                website all have <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code> tags. These tags are integral to ensuring that a website is accessible 
                                as it allows users who regularly use screen readers or other assistive technologies to relay 
                                the information about the graphic elements back to the reader. It also provides information 
                                to users what the image would be if the image could not be displayed due to external factors 
                                such as weak internet connection. When creating the <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code> tags for the graphics I used throughout 
                                the webpage, I made sure that the text is short and concise. This eliminates the overwhelming 
                                amount of information displayed for the user. Overall, though the website does not function well on mobile devices, it was highly
                                successful in being accessible on devices with a large screen as well as taking into 
                                careful consideration to the size, colour of the text and extra description of the image and graphics used through
                                the <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code> tags.

                                    Colours play a powerful role in design. During 
                                    the initial stages of designing my website, I 
                                    aimed  for a warm tone and an overall bright appearance. 
                                    These were the colour red, yellow, black and some blue tones. 
                                    This was to evoke an emotional response from the user, as colours 
                                    often carry specific emotions and can shape how people feel about 
                                    a design. Through these colour choices, I wanted to convey that I 
                                    am a “vibrant” and “happy” person, reflecting the personality and 
                                    “brand” I wanted to represent. Below is a mock-up of the initial 
                                    look of the website.

                                However, I soon realised that the brightness of these colours could 
                                become overwhelming the longer uses my website. After showing the 
                                mock-up to some friends, their feedback confirmed this concern. The 
                                colours felt too “loud” and was visually cluttered.

                                 a cooler colour scheme which was blue and yellow. I chose these 
                                 colours not only because these are my favourite colours, but because 
                                 they are easier on the eyes. Blue often represents calmness and peace, 
                                 helping to create a soothing atmosphere for users. On the otherhand, 
                                 yellow is often associated with joy and cheerfulness, this helps preserver 
                                 the upbeat impression I initially wanted for the website. As complementary 
                                 colours, blue and yellow created a balanced contrast that makes the design 
                                 both visually appealing and accessible for users.

                                    The layout of a website is integral for the user’s 
                                    experience and overall success of the design. 
                                    A well-structured layout ensures that the content 
                                    is accessible, visually appealing and user-friendly. 
                                    It also influences how users perceive the brand, which 
                                    in this case <i>my</i> brand. On the About Me page, I 
                                    purposefully made the text of the greeting large and used 
                                    the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag on my name, becoming the 
                                    salient element on the screen. This draws  the user’s attention 
                                    to the brief description about myself, while the image to the right 
                                    side fills in the awkward empty space. This creates a harmonious balance 
                                    layout. Then for the Past and Future pages, I used the <code>text-align: center;</code> 
                                    for the headings to make structure easy to follow and easy to follow. 
                                    Additionally, this also aids in creating a balanced and symmetrical 
                                    look for the contents on the page. For the body I used the 
                                    <code>text-align: left;</code>  to maintain readability and 
                                    prevent the content from appearing too cluttered.

                                    In terms of aesthetics, I chose a minimalistic design.
                                     This meant using a clean and simple layout with typography 
                                     that felt modern but not overwhelming. I selected fonts that 
                                     are widely available on most devices, such as Century Gothic.
                                     Due to the fact, the typeface has a soft, rounded apperance 
                                     that felt unique without being overly decorative. This greatly 
                                     helped in keeping the focus on the content while ensuring the 
                                     site remained easy to navigate and it is visually calming.
